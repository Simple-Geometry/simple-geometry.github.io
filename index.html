  <h1>Simple Geometry</h1>
  <h2>Websites with clarity, calm, and character.</h2>
  <p>Simple Geometry builds websites that feel easy to use and easy to like. Every page is designed with care, using just the right tools—HTML, CSS, JavaScript—to keep things clean, fast, and flexible. No fluff. No fuss.<br>The goal is simple: layouts that make sense, content that’s easy to read, and design that gets out of the way. Whether it’s a portfolio, a small business, or something in between, Simple Geometry creates digital spaces that are steady, clear, and quietly expressive.<br>Minimal, yes—but never boring.</p>
